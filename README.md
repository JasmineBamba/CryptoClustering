# Unsupervised Machine Learning

Unsupervised machine learning involves extracting patterns, structures, or relationships from data without labeled outcomes. It encompasses techniques like clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection, allowing algorithms to learn and explore data's inherent characteristics independently.

## Project Overview

The project aims to leverage Python and unsupervised learning techniques to forecast the influence of 24-hour versus 7-day price fluctuations on cryptocurrencies. The goal is to analyze and predict the impact of short-term (24-hour) and longer-term (7-day) price changes within the cryptocurrency market using machine learning methodologies.

## Preparing Data

To normalize the data from the CSV file using StandardScaler() from scikit-learn and create a DataFrame with the scaled data while setting the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame
